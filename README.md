# K-means from scratch on MNIST dataset
This project explores various different ways to classify digits on the MNIST dataset using various algorithms.

 ---

## Implemented from scratch (More added later):
 - K means 

## Implemented w/ Scikit learn:
- Least Squares classifier

## Coming soon
 - Convolutional Neural Network classifier
 - Confusion matrix & visualization
 - Performance benchmarking

## How to run (TBD)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
